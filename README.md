## Inspiration
Our inspiration for Seren AI came from witnessing the growing mental health crisis and the lack of accessible, personalized support. We wanted to create a solution that harnesses the power of AI to offer empathy and understanding, making mental health support more accessible to everyone, everywhere.

## What it does
Seren AI is a web-based AI counselor that provides mental health diagnostics. Users log in, fill in basic information, and record a video expressing their emotions. Our AI, hosted on Google Cloud, analyzes these videos for emotional cues and provides a detailed report on the user's mental state, offering insights and starting points for their wellness journey.

## How we built it
We built Seren AI using a blend of modern web technologies and AI. The frontend interfaces with Auth0 for secure logins, while the backend leverages Google Cloud's powerful AI capabilities. Video recordings are analyzed using advanced emotion recognition algorithms, ensuring accurate and sensitive interpretations of the user's emotional state.

## Challenges we ran into
Integrating different technologies was a major challenge. Ensuring data privacy and secure video uploads while maintaining a seamless user experience required meticulous planning and execution. Additionally, fine-tuning the AI to accurately interpret human emotions from videos was both technically challenging and ethically demanding.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of creating a platform that not only uses cutting-edge technology but does so in a way that's empathetic and user-friendly. We managed to maintain a high standard of data security and privacy while providing accurate and helpful mental health insights.

## What we learned
This project taught us a lot about integrating various technologies for a unified purpose. We learned about the complexities of emotion recognition AI and the importance of ethical AI practices, especially in sensitive areas like mental health.

## What's next for Seren.AI
Moving forward, we plan to enhance Seren AI's capabilities by incorporating more languages and cultural contexts, making it truly global. We're also looking into partnerships with mental health professionals to provide a more comprehensive support system for our users.
